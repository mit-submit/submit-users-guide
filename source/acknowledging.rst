Acknowledging subMIT
--------------------


It is very helpful for us to have a record of publications that made use
of subMIT resources (be those the physical hardware, or the human support
that we provide).

If possible, please send an e-mail letting us know you've published a
preprint or paper (to submit-help@mit.edu) that made use of our resources.

We would also appreciate it if you could acknolwedge subMIT in your
publications, where appropriate, with the following language:

*This work made use of resources provided by subMIT at MIT Physics.*

We will also periodically send around e-mails to the users lists reminding
users to let us know about any recently published papers.
